# getting-cleaningdata
Project Week 4

This repository is an outcome of the week 4 assignment for Coursera course "Getting & Cleaning Data" and includes the following files: 
cookbook.md
run_analysis.r 
tidy.txt

The cookbook modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

run_analysis is an r script that will download a group of files from the web and transform them into to the tidy dataset seen in tidy.txt.

tidy.txt is the tidy dataset and output of the script run_analysis.
